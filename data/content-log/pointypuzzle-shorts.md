- **Duration:** 26s
- **Hook:** Title card "50 ARROWS. 1 LIFE." over gameplay frame, confident VO: "Fifty arrows, twenty-five seconds, one heart. Easy."
- **Structure:** Single clip, no cuts. Full 25s gameplay attempt played at 1x. Dip-to-black at end.
- **VO:** Opening — confident/boastful setup. Closing — deflated "Maybe that was a little too hard."
- **SFX:** Slow tick-tock during early gameplay, faster tick-tock as timer gets low, alarm on final second.

## Is this the hardest level?

- **Published:** 2026-02-19
- **Video ID:** Nwj_WwZJwEE
- **Duration:** 17s
- **Hook:** ElevenLabs generated voice over says, "Level 6". Gameplay is sped up so arrows are flying off the grid fast. 
- **Structure:** ElevenLabs generated voice over says, "Level 6". Gameplay is sped up so arrows are flying off the grid fast. Voice over says, "Watch this puzzle disappear". with a few arrows left the voice over says, "...and solved".
- **VO:** ElevenLabs generated. "Level 6", "Watch this puzzle disappear", "...and solved."
- **Views:** 177
- **Avg View Duration:** 12s
- **Likes:** 1 | **Comments:** 1 | **Subs:** +1
- **What worked / didn't work:** Significantly underperformed the earlier batch (177 vs 1,300+). Shortest video at 17s. Question-style title without a strong difficulty claim ("hardest" is vague vs "Level 5" which is specific). May also just be algorithm variance. This was the first video generated by ShortCut. Also the first video which had AI generated voiceovers.

- **Structure:** Opens on solving Level 5. The text "Level 5 is where players quit..." is centered up top in orange text between the HUD and the puzzle with the player cleaing arrows immediately. About half way through I accidentally lose two hearts. The text "One Wrong Turn = Restart" shows immediately after that. Once I cleared the puzzle, "CAN YOU BEAT IT?" shows in big bold pink text and underneath, "Play it free at PointyPuzzle.com...and tell me what level you reach"
- **VO:** NONE
- **Views:** 1,614
- **Avg View Duration:** 17s
- **Likes:** 16 | **Comments:** 1 | **Subs:** +3
- **What worked / didn't work:** Strong performer. "Gets Brutal at Level 5" uses the specific-level hook that works well across the series. Same avg view duration as "Lost 2 hearts" (17s).

## Wait Until Level 4...

- **Published:** 2026-02-13
- **Video ID:** g0v5F9RPuLk
- **Duration:** 40s
- **Hook:** Thumbnail shows "Wait until Level 4" plastered diagonally over the puzzle. Level 3 (4 arrows) is shown with arrows be cleared immediately. "EASY?" is in big green centered text above the puzzle. 
- **Structure:** Thumbnail shows "Wait until Level 4" plastered diagonally over the puzzle. Level 3 (4 arrows) is shown with arrows be cleared immediately. "EASY?" is in big green centered text above the puzzle. Then Level 4 is shown and is captioned "Okay...try this." in pink letters. That puzzle is solved and "Beat Level 5. / pointypuzzle.com" centered on the screen over a blurred shot of Level 5. — At 40s this is the longest PointyPuzzle Short by far. Likely shows a multi-level progression?
- **VO:** NONE
- **Views:** 1,345
- **Avg View Duration:** 26s (BEST retention — 2x the average of other Shorts)
- **Likes:** 22 | **Comments:** 3 | **Subs:** +4
- **What worked / didn't work:** The retention standout. 26s avg on a 40s video = 65% retention, which is excellent for Shorts. The longer format with a slow build seems to keep people watching. "Wait Until Level 4" as a title creates anticipation — you have to keep watching to see what happens at Level 4. This is the format to study and replicate. This was just level 3 to 4 progression? What made the pacing work?**

## Only 10% Beat Level 4

- **Published:** 2026-02-13
- **Video ID:** G7eFlwtWmEU
- **Duration:** 24s
- **Hook:** Video opens on the Level 2 puzzle.
- **Structure:** Player easily solves it (6 arrows), celelbration animations + confetti are shown. Level 3 with 4 arrows is shown and the 3rd arrow clicked is invalid and the player loses a heart but immediately clears the level. Celebration shows again and then the video closes on "Beat Level 4. / pointypuzzle.com" centered on the screen over a blurred shot of Level 4.
- **VO:** No Voice Over
- **Views:** 1,347
- **Avg View Duration:** 12s
- **Likes:** 20 | **Comments:** 1 | **Subs:** +4
- **What worked / didn't work:** Published same day as "Wait Until Level 4" — both caught the algorithm on Feb 13 (2,516 views that day). Same view count but half the avg view duration (12s vs 26s). The "X% beat Level Y" challenge framing drives clicks but doesn't retain as well as the progression format. Good for views, less good for watch time. **[NEEDS ANNOTATION]**

## Patterns So Far

| Title Style | Avg Views | Avg View Duration | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| Specific level claim ("Level 4", "Level 5") | 1,431 | 17s | Consistent performers |
| Progression / "Wait until" | 1,345 | 26s | Best retention by far |
| Vague question ("hardest level?") | 177 | 12s | Underperformed (small sample) |
| Challenge / self-deprecating | 682* | TBD | Too early (ep01) |

*Still accumulating views

**Key insight:** Specific level numbers in titles outperform vague difficulty claims. The "Wait Until Level X" slow-build format retains 2x better than single-moment clips, even though views are similar.
