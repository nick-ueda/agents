# YouTube Brief — MazeDrop Comeback Short

**Date:** 2026-02-23
**Format:** Short (< 60s)
**Project:** MazeDrop
**Inspired by:** MazeDrop content has been dormant since Jan 20. Website traffic dropped 37%. But MazeDrop #56 hit 1,429 views last period — the format works, it just needs fresh content. One Short to re-establish presence.

## Title Options

1. **Curiosity gap:** "This maze looks easy... it's not"
2. **Descriptive:** "Today's daily maze in AR — MazeDrop"
3. **Story-based:** "I almost quit this maze halfway through"

## Hook (First 5-10 seconds)

Show the AR maze materializing on a real surface — table, floor, desk. The "wow it's in AR" factor is the immediate hook for people who haven't seen MazeDrop before. Voiceover: "Every day there's a new maze. Today's looks simple..." then the camera moves and reveals the maze is way more complex than it first appeared.

## Outline

1. AR maze appears on surface — visual wow factor
2. Start navigating — first few turns are easy
3. Hit a dead end or tricky section — tension builds
4. Either a satisfying solve or a restart — keep it real

## Key Moments to Capture

- The moment the AR maze first renders on a real-world surface (this is the differentiator)
- A smooth section where the ball rolls cleanly through turns
- A dead end or wrong turn — the frustration is relatable
- The solve moment with a clear view of the completed path

## Thumbnail Concept

Phone screen showing MazeDrop AR maze sitting on a real table/desk. The maze should look intricate. No text needed — the AR-on-real-surface visual is unusual enough to stop scrolling.

## Notes

- MazeDrop #56 (last period's top performer at 1,429 views) was a straightforward daily maze gameplay Short. Don't overthink the format — just get a fresh one out.
- The PointyPuzzle "level progression" hook could be adapted for MazeDrop: show an easy maze first, then today's harder one.
- This is about re-establishing presence, not going viral. One Short per week for MazeDrop keeps the algorithm warm.
- mazedrop.app link in description. Same verbal CTA test as PointyPuzzle: "play today's maze at mazedrop.app".
