## Title Options

1. **Curiosity gap:** "Nobody beats Level 6..."
2. **Descriptive:** "Level 1 to Level 6 — Watch it get impossible"
3. **Story-based:** "I didn't think I'd make it past Level 5"

## Hook (First 5-10 seconds)

Open on Level 1 gameplay — super easy, almost boring. Voiceover: "Level 1 is free. Level 2 is free. But Level 4..." Cut to the first moment the arrows get dense. The hook is the contrast between easy and hard — viewer needs to see the easy part to appreciate what's coming.

## Outline

1. Levels 1-3: Quick, smooth, satisfying clears — show competence
2. Level 4: First real challenge, a close call or near-miss
3. Level 5: Tension builds, slower pace, viewer should feel the difficulty ramp
4. Level 6: Either a clutch win or a dramatic fail — both work, but commit to one

## Key Moments to Capture

- A perfectly clean Level 1-2 clear (speed and ease sells the contrast)
- A near-death moment at Level 4 or 5 where one arrow almost ends the run
- The Level 6 board fully loaded with arrows — the visual density is the payoff
- Either a triumphant clear or a heartbreaking fail at Level 6

## Thumbnail Concept

Split screen: left side shows the clean, sparse Level 1 board. Right side shows the chaotic Level 6 board packed with arrows. Simple text overlay: "Level 1 → Level 6". The visual contrast does the work.

## Selected Title & Description

**Title:** Nobody beats Level 6...

**Description:**
Level 6 is supposed to be impossible. No hearts lost.

## Notes

- "Wait Until Level 4" format proved that the slow build retains 2x better than single-moment clips. This brief doubles down on that.
- Keep the voiceover minimal and casual — short reactions, not narration. "okay this is fine" → "wait" → "no no no" energy.
- Publishing in a cluster of 3-4 Shorts seems to trigger compounding algorithm pickup (Feb 13 had 2,500 views when two Shorts caught simultaneously). Consider batching this with 2-3 similar Shorts.
- Verbal CTA at the end: "try it free — pointypuzzle.com" — YouTube-to-web conversion is currently near zero, testing whether a spoken CTA helps.
