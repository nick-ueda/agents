## 2026-02-23 — PointyPuzzle player engagement stats

**Option A** (genuine surprise)
people are spending 6 minutes per session playing PointyPuzzle. for a free browser game with no account, no ads, no nothing — that feels really good.

**Option B** (self-deprecating)
I spent months building PointyPuzzle and had no idea if anyone would actually play it. turns out the average session is over 6 minutes. I don't even spend 6 minutes on most websites 🙃

**Option C** (hook/curiosity)
my free browser puzzle game has a 6-minute average session. I didn't pay for that stat. people are just... playing it. pointypuzzle.com if you want to try.

*Based on: PointyPuzzle GA4 showing 6m 9s avg session duration with 62 users this period*

## 2026-02-23 — YouTube Shorts hitting the algorithm

**Option A** (milestone)
one of my PointyPuzzle shorts hit 1,800 views this week. for a channel with 45 subscribers that's... not supposed to happen? Shorts algorithm is wild.

**Option B** (honest reaction)
went from basically 0 views to 2,500 in a single day because the Shorts algorithm decided to pick up my puzzle game videos. I have no idea how long this lasts but I'm going to keep making them.

**Option C** (numbers)
this month on youtube: 6,300 views, +12 subscribers, 96% of traffic from the Shorts feed. all from short PointyPuzzle gameplay clips. still under 50 subs but something is working.

*Based on: YouTube views up 259% to 6,309 this period, 96.4% from Shorts feed, net +12 subs*

## 2026-02-23 — The level progression hook that works

**Option A** (behind the scenes)
figured out what's working on my Shorts: videos that show the full level progression ("wait until level 4...") retain 2x longer than single-moment clips. the build-up matters more than the payoff.

**Option B** (lesson learned)
I was making Shorts that showed cool puzzle moments. they did okay. then I tried showing the full level-by-level progression and watch time doubled. turns out people want to see the struggle, not just the highlight.

**Option C** (casual observation)
"Wait Until Level 4" got 278 minutes of watch time with a 26-second avg view. my other shorts average 12-17 seconds. slow build > quick clip, apparently.

*Based on: "Wait Until Level 4" having 2x avg view duration (26s) vs other PointyPuzzle Shorts (12-17s)*

## 2026-02-23 — Indie dev reality: views ≠ web traffic

**Option A** (honest)
got 6,000 YouTube views this month. guess how many people clicked through to actually play the game? two. literally two. the YouTube-to-website pipeline does not exist yet and I need to figure that out.

**Option B** (funny)
my youtube shorts: 6,000 views
my website clicks from youtube: 2
conversion rate: 0.03%
me: this is fine 🙃

**Option C** (thinking out loud)
interesting problem: Shorts are great for views but terrible for sending people to your website. 6k views → 2 website visits. might need to lean on Twitter more for driving actual traffic to pointypuzzle.com.

*Based on: 6,309 YouTube views producing only 2 website sessions from YouTube referral traffic*

## 2026-02-23 — MazeDrop still alive

**Option A** (update)
haven't posted a MazeDrop video in a month and the website traffic dropped 37%. lesson learned: if you don't feed the algorithm, it forgets you exist. time to get back to making maze content.

**Option B** (honest check-in)
been so focused on PointyPuzzle shorts that I let MazeDrop go quiet for a month. traffic dropped. engagement is still solid when people visit though — 78% engagement rate. just need to give people a reason to visit again.

**Option C** (both projects)
balancing two games as a solo dev means one always gets neglected. PointyPuzzle's been getting all the love lately. MazeDrop's still cooking — just need to get back to posting about it.

*Based on: MazeDrop.app sessions down 37% with no new YouTube content since Jan 20*
