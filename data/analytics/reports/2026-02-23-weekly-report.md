### Top Performing Videos (This Period)

| Video | Views | Watch Time (min) | Avg View Duration | Likes | Subs Gained |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Lost 2 hearts but still cleared it | 1,817 | 180 | 17s | 27 | +6 |
| This Puzzle Gets Brutal at Level 5 | 1,614 | 166 | 17s | 16 | +3 |
| Only 10% Beat Level 4 | 1,347 | 120 | 12s | 20 | +4 |
| Wait Until Level 4 | 1,345 | 278 | 26s | 22 | +4 |
| Is this the hardest level? | 174 | 8 | — | 1 | — |

### Key Observations

- **"Wait Until Level 4"** had the highest avg view duration at **26 seconds** — nearly double the others — and the most watch time (278 min) despite fewer views. This format is retaining viewers.
- **Feb 13 was the single biggest day ever** with 2,516 views, driven by "Only 10% Beat Level 4" and "Wait Until Level 4" both catching the Shorts algorithm the same day.
- Views are very spiky — big days (Feb 13: 2,516, Feb 15: 1,380, Feb 18: 1,304) followed by sharp dropoffs. This is typical Shorts behavior where the algorithm pushes then moves on.
- **"Is this the hardest level?"** (published Feb 19) has only 174 views so far — significantly underperforming the earlier batch. Still early, but worth watching.
- Last period's top performer was **MazeDrop #56** (1,429 views) — a maze gameplay Short. This period's shift to PointyPuzzle content outperformed it across the board.

### Traffic Sources

| Source | Views | % of Total |
|---|---|---|
| Shorts Feed | 6,078 | 96.4% |
| YouTube Search | 153 | 2.4% |
| Channel Page | 42 | 0.7% |
| Other YouTube Pages | 30 | 0.5% |
| Subscriber Feed | 2 | 0.0% |

- Nearly **zero subscriber-driven views** — growth is coming from algorithm discovery, not the existing audience. This is normal at 45 subs but means each video lives or dies on algorithmic pickup.

## Website Performance

### PointyPuzzle (pointypuzzle.com)

| Metric | This Period | Last Period | Change |
|---|---|---|---|
| Page Views | 298 | 0 | New |
| Sessions | 116 | 0 | New |
| Users | 62 | 0 | New |
| Bounce Rate | 55.2% | — | — |
| Engagement Rate | 44.8% | — | — |
| Avg Session Duration | 6m 9s | — | — |

**Note:** Previous period shows 0 sessions — either GA4 was not yet installed on PointyPuzzle or the site wasn't live. This is the baseline period.

**Top Pages:**
- `/` (titled "Arrow Maze Puzzle") — 272 views, 101 sessions, 6m 39s avg session
- `/` (titled "Pointy Puzzle") — 26 views, 16 sessions, 2m 36s avg session

(Two title variants on the same path suggest the page title may have changed mid-period.)

**Traffic Sources:**
- Direct: 111 sessions (95.7%)
- YouTube: 2 sessions
- Google Organic: 1 session

- The **6+ minute avg session duration** is excellent for a puzzle game — people are actually playing, not bouncing.
- YouTube is driving almost no web traffic despite 6,000+ video views. The Shorts CTA links may not be converting, or viewers aren't clicking through.

### MazeDrop (mazedrop.app)

| Metric | This Period | Last Period | Change |
|---|---|---|---|
| Page Views | 76 | 118 | -35.6% |
| Sessions | 42 | 67 | -37.3% |
| Users | 42 | 67 | -37.3% |
| Bounce Rate | 21.4% | 23.9% | -2.5pp (better) |
| Engagement Rate | 78.6% | 76.1% | +2.5pp (better) |
| Avg Session Duration | 12.5s | 12.0s | +4.3% |

**Top Pages:**
- `/` — 75 views, 41 sessions
- `/privacy` — 1 view

**Traffic Sources:**
- Direct: 41 sessions (97.6%)
- DuckDuckGo Organic: 1 session

- Traffic is declining with no new MazeDrop YouTube content this period (last upload was Jan 20).
- Engagement metrics remain strong — the 78.6% engagement rate means visitors who do arrive are interacting with the site.
- Essentially zero organic search traffic for MazeDrop.

## Content Opportunities

**For the SMM Agent — use these to inform content strategy:**

1. **PointyPuzzle "level progression" Shorts are the clear winner.** The four videos with "Level 4" / "Level 5" difficulty framing all broke 1,000 views. The hook pattern of "wait until Level X" or "only X% beat Level Y" is consistently triggering the Shorts algorithm. **Keep making these.**

2. **"Wait Until Level 4" had 2x the avg view duration (26s vs 12-17s) of similar videos.** This suggests the slower build / progression format retains better than the "look at this one moment" format. The SMM Agent should brief videos that show a full level progression rather than a single highlight clip.

3. **YouTube-to-website conversion is essentially zero.** 6,000+ video views produced only 2 website sessions from YouTube. The Shorts descriptions include pointypuzzle.com links, but they're not converting. Consider:
   - Adding an end-screen or pinned comment with the URL
   - Testing a verbal CTA in the voiceover ("try it free at pointypuzzle.com")
   - Twitter could be a better funnel for web traffic since links are more prominent

4. **MazeDrop content has gone cold.** No new MazeDrop videos since Jan 20, and website traffic is dropping. If MazeDrop is still in active development, even one Short per week would maintain presence. The MazeDrop #56 Short got 1,429 views last period — the format works, it just needs fresh content.

5. **PointyPuzzle's 6-minute avg session is a strong talking point for Twitter.** "People are spending 6 minutes playing my free browser puzzle game" is a great indie dev brag. The SMM Agent should draft tweets that highlight real player engagement stats.

6. **The Shorts algorithm is spiky — volume matters.** The biggest days (2,500+ views) happened when multiple videos were live and catching simultaneously. Publishing 3-4 Shorts in a cluster seems to create a compounding effect vs spacing them out.
